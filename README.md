# Invoice Generator with VBA

The Invoice Generator is an Excel template with a range of VBA programs designed to automate the process of generating invoices and provide a centralized overview of invoice status. This tool simplifies the administrative tasks involved in invoice management, reducing the time and effort required for invoice creation.

## Purpose

The purpose of this tool is to streamline the invoicing procedure and provide a comprehensive view of invoice-related information. It aims to make the invoice creation process efficient, taking only a few clicks and 2-3 minutes per invoice, instead of 20-30 minutes. By consolidating invoice data in one place, it allows users to track completed jobs, manage open invoices, and monitor revenue.

## Features

- **Easy customer data management**: Input and update customer information in the *Masterdata* tab.
- **Simple invoice management and creation**: Update invoice information in the *Invoice* tab and generate invoices in both PDF and Excel formats with a single click.
- **Email integration**: Generate a draft email with an attached PDF invoice for efficient customer communication.
- **Dashboard insights**: Utilize the *Calculations* tab to prepare data for informative charts on the *Dashboard* tab, allowing you to monitor monthly revenue effectively.
- **Customizable template**: Personalize the invoice template by adding your logo, modify the workbook, or edit the VBA code according to your company's specific requirements.

## Repository Structure

The Invoice Generator repository is structured as follows:

- **Invoice_Generator.xlsm**: The main Excel template that comes with a range of Macros and Forms. It serves as the core tool for automating the process of invoice generation. Users can customize and adapt the template according to their specific requirements.
- **VBA Code**: This folder contains the comprehensive range of VBA code that powers the Invoice Generator programs in **Invoice_Generator.xlsm**.
  - **Forms**: This subfolder houses the code responsible for various Form events.
  - **Modules**: This subfolder contains the code for module sub procedures.
- **PDF Invoices**: This folder contains the PDF versions of created invoices. These sample invoices showcase the formatting and layout of the generated invoices.
- **Excel Invoices**: This folder contains the Excel versions of created invoices. These sample invoices showcase the formatting and layout of the generated invoices.
- **Sample Email Outputs**: This folder includes sample Outlook emails that are generated by the VBA programs. It provides examples of the emails that can be generated with PDF invoice attached.

## VBA Code Glossary

The VBA Code Glossary provides an overview of the different components and functionality of the VBA code used in the Invoice Generator programs. It lists the various controls, their related events and sub procedures, along with their descriptions and locations within the Excel workbook. This glossary serves as a handy reference for understanding the VBA code structure and helps users navigate and customize the Invoice Generator according to their specific needs.

To edit the VBA code, open the VBA editor by pressing `Alt + F11` key. This will provide access to the full range of underlying VBA code that drives the programs. Utilize the **VBA Code Glossary** provided above as a reference to navigate to the specific code you want to customize. Make the desired changes and adjustments as per your requirements. 

To access the code related to a particular form control button, right-click the button and choose "Assign Macro" -> "Edit". This will open the VBA editor directly to the code associated with the button, allowing you to modify its functionality. To import a VBA program to your own workbook, open the VBA editor, go to "File" -> "Import File" and select a VBA code file from the downloaded *VBA Code* folder.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Excel (version 2010 or later) with macros enabled.
- Basic knowledge of VBA and Microsoft Excel is recommended to make modifications to the template.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Invoice Generator, follow these steps:

1. Update Master Data: Input your original customer master data in the Master Data tab. Add new customers using the Add Customer button on the Dashboard tab. Edit customer information using the Edit Master Data button.

2. Update the Template: Customize the invoice template by adding your logo. Review the VBA code to ensure all necessary modifications are made.



## Usage

1. Adding Invoice Information: In the Invoice tab, enter the customer's name, select the correct customer from the list, and provide the necessary details.
